# mummySSH
My Custom Go SSH Client

## What's It About
Need something that can chat with Vault for 
connecting into remote servers, specifically in AWS.

This is a work in progress...Including this readme, needs some love.



src/github.com/helloyi/go-sshclient is a fork of https://github.com/helloyi/go-sshclient/ That I've modded
I would also do a `go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`
